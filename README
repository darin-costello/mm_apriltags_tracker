mm_apriltags_tracker (Multi camera Mulit apriltag tracker)

Requires:
The april tag detection library found here. http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/
opencv2
Eigen

This package requires multiple cameras to be run simultaneously.
You must have a parameter map named abs_april_tag_loc where each key:value pair has the form tagnumberX/Y:centerLocation.

Each camera only needs to see one tag from abs_april_tag_loc. The tags needed to be printed two to a page(This can be adjusted by changing the value of APRILTAGSIZE in mm_apriltags_tracker.cpp). Using the corners tags the camera computes a homograph matrix, The camera then will publish the translated location of any april tag it detects, not listed in abs_april_tag_loc.

There are two macros to help customize the behavior of the program They are defined at the top of mm_apriltags_tracker.cpp. The first is ROBOT. Defining this to a specific number will publish that april tag's location and rotation to the topic /robot_pos. The second is DRAW, which when defined will present what the cameras are seeing.

video.launch file requires the argument cam:=num, where num is the number of the camera you want to use. This can be found by running
ls /dev | grep video

launchAll.launch will launch cameras 0 and 1.
